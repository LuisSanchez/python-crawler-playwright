## Assignment 

Give a CSV file of company names, create a script that can find linkedin URLs for those companies. The linkedin URLs should be stored as a CSV file. And once that is done, extend the script using Playwright browser to find the employee count from LinkedIn.

### Note
This script uses basic web scraping techniques and might not work perfectly if LinkedIn changes their website structure. It is recommended to use a dedicated web scraping library like Scrapy for more robust and reliable scraping.
